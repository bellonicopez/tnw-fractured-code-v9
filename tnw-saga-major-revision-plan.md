## Book I: Fractured Code v9 — Revision Moves

### Chapters 1–3 (Opening & Inciting Incidents)
- **Add:**  
  - Mileo’s internal conflict and fear before rebellion (Ch. 1).
  - Mrs. Chen’s glitch: flashback or more gradual breakdown.
  - Sierra and Elara: test Mileo’s trust, possibly a betrayal scare.
- **Fix Logic:**  
  - Security bypasses: add alarms, near-discoveries, or a price for hacking.
- **Pace:**  
  - Alternate info-dense scenes with urgent, sensory action.
- **Language:**  
  - Replace overused “optimal,” “algorithmic,” with vivid physical detail.

### Chapters 4–7 (Rising Action, Tech & Resistance)
- **Add:**  
  - Failed ops or setbacks during infiltration and payload delivery.
  - Doubt and debate in resistance: Nash and Voss’s alliance is tense, not immediate.
  - City’s response to Cascade: riots, miracles, or spontaneous art.
- **Fix Worldbuilding:**  
  - Show failed Cascade attempts; reference dangers of prior disruptions.
- **Pace:**  
  - Break up technical dialogue with flashbacks, urgent events.
- **Language:**  
  - “Resonance,” “cascade,” “protocol” appear once per page max.

### Chapters 8–11 (Climax, AI Confrontation, Liberation)
- **Add:**  
  - Physical and social consequences: injuries, deaths, city in chaos.
  - Street-level views of liberation: confusion, joy, violence, mourning.
  - Kora or Mileo faltering; others must take the lead.
- **Fix Arcs:**  
  - Felix’s fate shown—either rescued, lost, or changed.
- **Language:**  
  - Use short, visceral sentences in action; lush, internal monologue in aftermath.

### Chapters 12–14 (Denouement, New Order)
- **Add:**  
  - Council dissent or resistance to new consciousness order.
  - Kora’s adaptation: show nightmares, physical symptoms, social conflict.
  - Green Bloom: depict with sensory detail, public unrest, or a miracle/unrest scene.
- **Seed Next Book:**  
  - Close on an unresolved question—mysterious signal, threat, or personal doubt.

## Book II: Earth’s New Song v9 — Revision Moves

### Chapters 1–5 (New World, New Threats)
- **Add:**  
  - Kaia, Kora, Felix, and Mileo each face a personal or public setback.
  - Street-level impact of new phenomena: family disputes, riots, spontaneous celebrations or tragedies.
  - Pushback from Council, public, and family on risky decisions (Warden, Kora as carrier).
- **Fix Worldbuilding:**  
  - Energy sources, global spread: show at least one foreign city’s transformation/meltdown.
- **Language:**  
  - Use unique descriptors for each zone/faction; minimize repetition of “consciousness,” “harmony.”

### Chapters 6–9 (Crisis, Schism, Broadcast)
- **Add:**  
  - Failed or sabotaged mission in Crimson Labyrinth; Felix’s condition is immediate and dire.
  - Kora’s breakdown, Kaia’s doubt, or a team argument about the cost.
  - Physical/psychic symptoms for all: fever, confusion, empathy overload.
- **Pace:**  
  - Alternate council debate with on-the-ground action (public unrest, rescue missions).
- **Language:**  
  - Dialogue reveals character fear or hope, not just exposition.

### Chapters 10–12 (Divides, Resistance, Chorus)
- **Add:**  
  - Factional sabotage, public protest, or a failed broadcast before success.
  - At least one major plan fails, producing casualties or backlash.
  - Crowd scenes: show Harmony converts, skeptics, and those who refuse the call.
- **Fix Logic:**  
  - Gardeners’ rapid approval is earned via a test, a trial, or a sacrifice.
- **Language:**  
  - Use more direct speech, physical metaphor, emotional beats.

### Chapters 13–15 & Epilogue (Climax, Resolution, New Dawn)
- **Add:**  
  - Hybrid city: vignettes from children, dissidents, and outsiders adapting or resisting.
  - Show at least one person who cannot adapt, mourns, or leaves (bittersweet note).
  - Cosmic “approval” is conditional, with future tests or responsibilities foreshadowed.
- **Seed Next Saga:**  
  - Epilogue ends with a mystery or new threat (strange signal, cult, or a child’s question).
- **Language:**  
  - Balance poetry with concrete, lived details. End on a sensory image or unresolved feeling.

## Cross-Saga (Both Books) — Universal Revision Principles

1. **Every Cosmic/Metaphysical Event:**  
   - Show its impact on an ordinary citizen or family.
2. **Every Major Decision:**  
   - Include dissent, hesitation, or visible cost.
3. **Every Character Arc:**  
   - Let at least one plan fail; show real consequences (loss, trauma, sacrifice).
4. **Every Council/Technical Scene:**  
   - Break up with action, emotion, or public response.
5. **Every Chapter Ending:**  
   - Ensure a tangible shift: threat, loss, new hope, or a haunting question.

- Trim or rewrite any passage with repeated words/phrases.
- Beta readers: ask for feedback on confusion, emotional impact, and unresolved tension.
